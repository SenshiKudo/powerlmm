## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this submission I've fixed:

* Removed double spaces from the DESCRIPTION file.
* Added a reference to the 'Description' field. However, this package
    extends the method described in the article, which is described in detail
    in the vignette "technical".
* Fixed a small typo in 'man/study_parameters.Rd'

## Test environments
* local OS X (Sierra, 10.12.6) install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* "Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: misspecification".
    This spelling is prefered in the literature. 

## Reverse dependencies
This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
