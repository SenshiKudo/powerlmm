Description: Design two- and three-level multilevel longitudinal
    studies with missing data. Both the third-level factor (e.g. therapists, 
    schools, or physicians), and the second-level factor (e.g. subjects), 
    can be assigned random slopes. Studies with partially nested designs, 
    unequal cluster sizes, unequal allocation to treatment arms, and different 
    dropout patterns per treatment are supported. For all designs power can be 
    calculated both analytically and via simulations. Additionally, 
    the simulation tools provides flexible ways to investigate bias, type I 
    errors and the consequences of model misspecification.
